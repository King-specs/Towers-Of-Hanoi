# Towers-Of-Hanoi
This repository presents a recursive solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem implemented in C++. The Towers of Hanoi puzzle is a classic problem that involves three pegs and a stack of disks of different sizes. The goal is to move all disks from the source peg to the destination peg, with the help of an auxiliary peg. The constraints are simple yet challenging: only one disk can be moved at a time, and a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

This C++ program prompts the user for the number of disks and then prints each step required to solve the puzzle, detailing every move from one peg to another. The solution illustrates the power of recursion, as each step relies on solving a smaller version of the same problem. The code includes basic error handling to ensure the number of disks is a valid positive integer. This project is an ideal example for those learning about recursion and algorithmic thinking, as it breaks down a complex problem into simple, repetitive actions.
